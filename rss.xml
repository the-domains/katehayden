            <description><![CDATA[<p>As a runner, retired Royal Navy rehabilitation trainer, and mother – I am passionate about helping people to learn what they need to do to change their behaviours and life-style and have developed a Simple Steps approach to achieve health and wellbeing. These simple steps are based around taking a whole life approach to health, fitness and well-being through the mind, nutrition, environment, support, and exercise, pretty much in that order of importance. The final two steps are about accountability and action, making it happen! This is my vocation and I strongly believe that people should learn what they need to change their lives for the better and then move on to live that life and spread their knowledge by example.</p>]]></description>
