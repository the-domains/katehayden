  HealthyHITÂ® Pilates is a series of 6 different classes, each lasting just
  30mins that works you hard, but teaches you correct technique to ensure you
  complete the workout in the right way. HIT (High Intensity Training) is a
  great concept, and the physiology behind it fascinating. However, many people
  completing other HIT programs do so with very poor technique, and work at a
  level that their bodies may not be capable of.

HealthyHIT(r) Pilates is a series of 6 different classes, each lasting just 30mins that works you hard, but teaches you correct technique to ensure you complete the workout in the right way. HIT (High Intensity Training) is a great concept, and the physiology behind it fascinating. However, many people completing other HIT programs do so with very poor technique, and work at a level that their bodies may not be capable of.

The APPI's HealthyHIT(r) program ensures that those same amazing benefits of the HIT physiology are achieved, but with correct form and function.

\* Incorporating appropriate rest periods and Pilates exercises to balance the program.

\* All the movements are based on existing Pilates movements but taken to an entirely new level.

\* Using various small equipment to mix up the challenge and target different areas of the body, the HealthyHIT(r) Pilates program is on its way to changing the face of Pilates!
