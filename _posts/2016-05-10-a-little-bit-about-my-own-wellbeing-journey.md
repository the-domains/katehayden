A little bit about my own wellbeing journey......

As a kid I was always sporty - I dreamed of being an Olympian when I grew up. I remember being completely inspired after watching the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow and being introduced to athletics.My father used to call me "sparrow legs" as I was a skinny 11 year old, not looking too dissimilar to my idol Zola Budd. 

So it seemed like a natural next-step when I left school aged 17, to join the Royal Navy as a fitness instructor. But what I hadn't quite imagined was how the pressure of being one of just 18 women in a group of 250 badass naval fitness instructors was going to affect my self-esteem and body image.  
  

It can do funny things to your head when you're young, your body's changing, and you're trying to show up every day as a kind of role model of physical perfection. It's hard to put my finger on the exact moment things began to slide, but over time I began to develop an unhealthy relationship with food.It was the early stages of an eating disorder which would come to shape and overshadow my life for the next 12 years. 

I couldn't bring myself to confide in my colleagues for fear of being labelled 'not up to the job'. I felt ashamed, weak and alone. Impulsive eating was followed by hours of obsessively punishing myself in the gym.

I knew deep down there must be a better way...

The turning point came 6 months after my first daughter was born in 2002\. Although by now I was 3 stone overweight, I made a promise to her that I would do whatever it took to build a healthy relationship with food and exercise. I was committed to being a fit and healthy Mum for her. This was a promise I was determined to keep.

In the following months I immersed myself in research around health, fitness, and the power of the subconscious mind. Combining all of this new learning with my long experience in fitness, I began to piece together the real-life secrets to maintaining healthy weight and fitness without counting calories, long hours in the gym or feeling deprived. My excess weight began to steadily fall away and to my huge surprise I actually enjoyed the process!

Returning to work, I felt it was time for a change.In keeping with the new perspectives I was developing, I chose to re-train as a Rehabilitation Instructor working with injured military service personnel returning from Afghanistan, coaching them back to full fitness. Many of them were fighting weight issues due to their injuries. It was a vicious cycle -- their injuries were hampering them from getting fit, their lack of fitness leads to weight gain, and the extra weight was aggravating their injuries.

It was while working with them that I first began to develop the gentle but effective system that would eventually form the underlying philosophy for 'Steady Steps to Slim'. The final pieces of the puzzle had fallen into place.

Since retiring from the navy in 2012, I've used my skillset to help ordinary people permanently shed weight that may have been holding them back for years. Using my safe and easy guided system, I support and encourage them step-by-step around all the pitfalls and disappointments that no-one else seems to talk about, so they can shed the excess weight, feel great in their clothes again, and generally just get their mojo back. 

On a personal front, I used my advanced knowledge of fitness, nutrition and mindset to become the first British woman ever to complete the gruelling 250 mile Thames Ring Ultra Run in July this year. I do not declare this to impress you but to simply in press on you that the power of the mind can be limitless when it is directed in a positive way. 

And while I know not everyone fancies running marathons like me, I deeply believe that we all deserve to lead fit and healthy lives, enjoy food without feeling guilty and feel good in our bodies.

If this sounds good to you (or just more of who you'd
like to be), then I'd love to be part of your success story.
