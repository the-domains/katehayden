I believe that simplicity is the answer to life's challenges. Make it part of your routine behaviour to step away from the overwhelm so that your very capable mind can have the space to follow your own agenda; free from the insistent and constant pecking of messages that are only designed to influence your daily decisions in their favour and usually for financial gain.

On the surface the part of your life that you feel may need improving may appear to simply be weight control, fitness or career stress and the typical approach is to tackle these problems in a fairly one dimensional way, i.e. weight control or fitness by eating less and exercising more respectively. This approach is also usually doomed as diets become difficult to maintain for any length of time and exercise unless it has specific achievable goals soon plateaus and eventually falls by the way-side.

As a runner, retired Royal Navy rehabilitation trainer, and mother -- I am passionate about helping people to learn what they need to do to change their behaviours and life-style and have developed a Simple Steps approach to achieve health and wellbeing. These simple steps are based around taking a whole life approach to health, fitness and well-being through the mind, nutrition, environment, support, and exercise, pretty much in that order of importance. The final two steps are about accountability and action, making it happen! This is my vocation and I strongly believe that people should learn what they need to change their lives for the better and then move on to live that life and spread their knowledge by example.
